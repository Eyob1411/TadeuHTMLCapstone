# Using Bootstrap

Hey! In this project the main objective was to work on the frontend, by creating a HTML version of [this project right here]().

I've used HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap 4. Most of the elements are built with a combination of Bootstrap and CSS. Except the ´<footer>´, which was entirely made with pure CSS.
